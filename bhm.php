    <p>
      <u><a href="https://www.history.com/topics/black-history/black-history-month" target="_blank">Black History Month</a></u> is an annual observance recognizing important people and events American history with organizational roots that date back to 1926 thanks to the efforts of historian Carter G. Woodson. Back then, the event was known as <u><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_History_Month" target="_blank">Negro History Week</a></u> primarily focused on encouraging the teaching of the black American history to public school students.

      In 1929, The Journal of Negro History reported that the majority of "every state with considerable Negro population" had distributed official literature associated with the event. Forty years later, black educators and the Black United Students at Kent State University proposed a "Black History Month", and offered the first celebration in 1970.

      It has been more than forty years since President Gerald Ford, in 1976, became the first United States government official to recognize what has become a national holiday, and is now observed in Canada, Ireland, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. However, there are still challenges for black Americans to overcome in order to become whole, and it all begins with understanding ones history.

    <h3>What does it mean to be Black in America?</h3>
    <p>
      Well, it depends on who you ask. The <u><a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/black" target="_blank">Merriam-Webster</a></u> dictionary defines black as, 'a very dark color; having dark skin; of or relating to African American people; dirty, soiled; thoroughly sinister or evil.' I don’t know about you, but I am not convinced.
    </p>
    <p>Do you agree with that definition? </p>
    <p>
      Lets' search another dictionary, this time, a much older reference. The <u><a href="http://webstersdictionary1828.com/Dictionary/black " target="_blank">American Dictionary of the English Language</a></u> written in 1828 (pre-emancipation) is a good place to start. And it defines black as, ‘of the color of night; sullen; atrociously wicked; dismal; a negro.’
    </p>
    <p>
      Well now, I'm confused. The contemporary definition of black references black people as 'African-American', but the older version defines black people as 'negro.' When I consider these terms that are used to describe me, I become sad. Sad because I do not understand why my ancestors allowed other people to call me something that I am not.
    </p>
    <p>
      First and foremost, I am not African-American because my ancestors nor myself migrated from Africa. To be a Chinese-American, an Italian-American or a Mexican-American, one must migrate from China, Italy or Mexico, respectively, to America. Right?
    </p>
    <p>
       So, why am I referred to as an African-American? And what else were my ancestors referred to throughout history?
    </p>
    <ol class="subGrid" alpha>
      <li>Slave</li>
      <li>Nigger</li>
      <li>Negro</li>
      <li>Colored</li>
      <li>African-American</li>
      <li>Black American</li>
      <li>Person of Color</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Wow! Those are some interesting concepts, none of which accurately describes who I am as a person. Although cordially accepted by descendants of European immigrants, all of these descriptions are misnomers, specifically the term black as I am obviously a shade of brown. Simply put: I am American, am I not? What about YOU?

    <h3>"HIStory" by <span class="author">Gil Scott Heron</span></h3>
    <p>
    <u><a href="http://webstersdictionary1828.com/Dictionary/black" target="_blank">Gil Scott Heron</a></u> was a legendary poet born in Chicago, Illinois. His parents were famous: his mother was an opera singer and his father an international futbol star.

          A natural writer, Gil developed a skill as a writer in his youth, which helped him earn a scholarship to an exclusive prep school. He enrolled in university, but got bored and dropped out. The next year, he published his first book, at age 19. He would later earn an M.A. in creative writing <i>after</i> beginning a professional music career! 
        </p>
        <p>
          Gil's work was strongly influenced by the work of Langston Hughes, Malcom X and Otis Redding to name a few. He wrote extensively on topics regarding racism, socioeconomic injustice and white privilege all while exploring  the facts of the human condition. In modern times, he is recognized as a 'rapping' pioneer! The <u><a href="https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/gilscottheron/blackhistorytheworld.html" target="_blank">Lyrics</a></u> to 'HIS Story' are powerful and gives some insight into this American political revolutionary icon!
