          I was born in Louisville, Kentucky and raised in a single-parent household. The relationship between my father and I had severed at age seven, and his absence could best explain the behavioral and emotional rollercoaster that I would endure throughout my youth. Environmental and financial woes frequently displaced my family, but we were able to cope with scarce provisions.

          At age 11, I discovered a passion for playing basketball, and devoted all of my energy toward the sport. Like many of the kids that I grew up with, attending college was an elusive life experience attainable only through athletic scholarship. I developed well as a player competing in amateur athletics, which led to my enrollment at an academically rigorous institution that allowed me to showcase my athletic talents while preparing me for a tertiary education. As a senior and team captain, I led my school to a state tournament and had received my fair share of scholarship offers. That was until I blew out my knee: my injury scared aware every school that had recruited me, resulting in 100% of all offers being rescinded. Because I graduated in the top-percentile of my class, being accepted into a university was not much of a challenge. Paying the tuition, on the other hand, was and so I hedged a bet to mortgage my future for a university education!

          While attending university, I became interested in economics and political science: I wanted to better understand the system functionality of American democracy. The opportunities to explore this field were ample while living the student life: I performed internships with local, state and federal government agencies, explored tort law at a prestigious university and provided assistance for a limited liability company with drafting an overseas private investment corporation application. As a university graduate, however, I was not as fortunate in procuring suitable employment related to my degree. Moreover, I had come to the stark reality that attending law school was an expense that I simply could not afford. Instead of settling for the first job to become available, I embarked on a sojourn abroad to teach English as a Second Language. I landed in South Korea three months after graduating university with the mindset that I would save up for law school. That didn't happen. Instead, I began to explore the world, having since travelled to nearly two dozen nations. I accomplished these feats, and many more, through my service to others which was teaching~

          Basketball was always more than a game for me: it was an outlet for expression and a means to achieve the American dream. Being an athlete allowed me to become a scholar. Being a scholar led me to study multiple disciplines at seven colleges and universities in three countries. Through education I altered the trajectory of my future and in the process I became an educator.
