        <p>
          My career as an educator began while studying at the University of Louisville where I earned a degree in political science. It was here I gained leadership experience through a plethora of opportunities, but it was my role serving at-risk youth for a <a href="https://www.cabbagepatch.org/" target="_blank">non-profit</a> that convinced me of my calling: I was 19. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Shortly after graduation, I embarked on a sojourn abroad to teach English as a second language. What was supposed to have been a gap year before enrolling in law school turned into a life altering foreign cultural immersive experience.
        </p>
        <p>
          Life as an emigrant was challenging, yet, as a life-learner having formally studied Francais, Espanol, Hangul, Nihongo and Putonghua, I empathize well with language acquisition struggles learners encounter. Some of the agencies that enabled me to practice my craft include Sogang University, Oxford Seminars, Joongdong High School, YBM Academy, Chien-Shiung Institute of Technology, Tongxiang Middle School, Shanghai Ocean University and Jiaxing College.

        My interest in web technologies stems from my participation in <a href="https://codelouisville.org" target="_blank">&#60;code&#62; Louisville</a>, a web dev platform that introduces best practices and concepts related to front-end web development. To this end, I can design, develop and deploy a website to specification. Currently doing my part to build the ecosystem, most recently helping organize a local <a href="https://startupweekendlouisville.com/" target="_blank">startup event</a>. Working on an <a href="webdesign/">e-book</a> for folks interested in learning the craft.
