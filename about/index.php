      <h1 style="text-align: center; margin: 0.44em 0;">I Make Learning Fun!</h1>
      <p>
        I am a substitute teacher with  <a href="http://jefferson.kyschools.us" target="_blank">J.C.P.S.</a> where I provide learning services to youth of all ages. I have held this position since <code>January 2018</code> and have been awarded <code>100+</code> assignments at <code>42</code> schools where I have facilitated lessons to more than <code>2,800</code> students.

      <!-- Teacher Interest --> 
      <p>
        I first ventured into the field of education as a student at the University of Louisville where I earned a degree in political science. I gained invaluable leadership experience through a plethora of opportunities afforded to me. Yet, my role serving at-risk youth for a <a href="https://www.cabbagepatch.org/" target="_blank">non-profit</a> convinced me of my calling: I was 19. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Shortly after graduation, I embarked on a sojourn abroad: what should have been a gap year before enrolling in law school turned into a life altering culturally immersive experience. <!--My job as an ESL instructor was exceptionally rewarding as my experience having formally studied Francais, Espanol, Hangul, Nihongo and Putonghua helped me empathize with language acquisition struggles my learners encountered.-->

      <!-- 'Web Developer' Introduction -->
      <p>
        In my free time, I tinker with web technologies and am currently developing a portfolio to illustrate my proficiencies as a web developer, an interest that stems from my participation in a pseudo-<a href="https://codelouisville.org" target="_blank">boot camp</a> that introduces web dev best practices and concepts. To this end, I can design, develop and deploy a website to spec. Explore my <a href="webdev/toolkit">toolkit</a> to ascertain my knowledge.
