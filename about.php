      <div>
        <p>
          I was born in Louisville, Kentucky and raised in a single-parent household. The relationship between my father and I was broken at age seven, and his abscence could best explain the behavioral and emotional rollercoaster that I would endure throughtout my youth. Environmental and financial woes caused my family to be uprooted frequently while being compelled to make due with scarce provisions. 
        </p>
        <p>
          At age 11, I discovered a passion for playing basketball, and devoted all of my energy toward the sport. Like many of the kids that I grew up with, attending college was an elusive life experience attainable only through athletic scholarship. I developed well as a player competing in amateur athletics and was enrolled at an academically rigorous institution that allowed me to showcase my athletic talents while preparing me for a tertiary education. As a four year letterman and team captain, I led my school to a state tournament and had received my fair share of scholarship offers. That was until I blew out my knee and was forced to reevaluate my future as 100% of all offers were rescinded. Because I graduated in the top-percentile of my class, being accepted into a university was not much of a challenge. Paying the tuition, on the other hand, was and so I hedged a bet to mortgage my future for a university education! 
        </p>
        <p>
          Basketball was always more than a game for me: it was an outlet for expression and a means to attain a middle-class lifestyle. Being an athlete allowed me to become a scholar. Being a scholar led me to study multiple disciplines at seven colleges and universities in three countries. Through education I was able to change the trajectory of my future and in the process I became an educator.

            I am currently engaged in self-fulfilling work teaching youth in my hometown after living abroad for most of my adult life. In desperate need of brushing up on my Mandarin and Spanish language skills. Coding like crazy! Thinking seriously about enrolling in an accredited graduate teaching program. Would like to open a neighborhood summer school that introduces individuals to software programming in an effort to enable folks with skills that they can use to jumpstart a web development career.

        Self-taught web implementation specialist able to proficiently design, develop and deploy a web application to specification. As a designer, I can adapt a low-fidelity prototype into a viable website using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, content management tools and digital media. As a developer, I utilize the PHP scripting language that incorporates object-oriented programming practices to integrate server-side functionality into a web application. Vital components of this process entails auscultating user-experience; amalgamating accessibility, performance requirements and other technical considerations; HTTP server installation; database configuration; and using the SSH protocol in conjunction with version control to provide secure remote access to mitigate maintenance concerns. To this end, I am currently exploring opportunities by which I can leverage my skillset to pursue a position in the tech industry.
